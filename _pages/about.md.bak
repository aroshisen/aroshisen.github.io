My passion for engineering started during the kindergarten when I was fascinated by the underlying mysteries of the natural phenomena that people encounter every day. My dream of becoming an Engineer became true when I was selected to the most most prestigious state universities of Sri Lanka, The University of Peradeniya.

During the freshman year, I got the opportunity to learn various aspects of Engineering ranging from Civil to Computer Engineering, through different modules and practical sessions offered by each of these departments. In my sophomore year, I chose to specialize in Civil Engineering. After my first industrial training at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, I found my true passion is for Environmental Engineering.

I have managed to balance my academic work with a fair amount of time getting involved in extracurricular activities. Holding committee positions in various clubs and societies in my university  has taught me how to organize events and work with a diverse group of people.

I love cooking. I maintain a sepearate instagram page share my cooking. [see my cool recepies](https://www.instagram.com/foodieoogoodie/)
