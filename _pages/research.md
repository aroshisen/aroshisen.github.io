### Projects 

- **Development of an adsorbent material to remove Fluoride from water** 
  *Supervised by Dr. K.G.N. Nanayakkara*
  Developed a novel chitosan-biochar composite adsorbent material to remove fluoride from groundwater. Besides, a comparative study was done with raw chitosan powder. Fluoride sorption equilibrium was reached after 1 hour with an excellent removal efficiency of 90% for modified adsorbent while raw powder only exhibited a removal efficiency of 16%.

- **Design of a new bridge to reduce traffic congestion in Peradeniya junction** 
  *Supervised by Dr. D. De S. Udakara, Dr. G.M.P.R. Weerakoon, Dr. H.D. Yapa, and Mr. D.D. Dias*
  Designed a new two-lane prestress concrete bridge parallel to the existing Peradeniya Bridge to mitigate the traffic congestion in the Peradeniya junction. The bridge design was done using Autodesk Structural Bridge design 2019 software.

- **Investigating industrial waste treatment procedures in a brewery industry**  
  *Supervised by Prof. K.B.S.N. Jinadasa*
  Brewery waste treatment procedure in Heineken Lanka Pvt. Ltd. was observed and analyzed to investigate the existing treatment facilities. Besides, new improvable methods were suggested to the treatment system and possible difficulties were addressed.
