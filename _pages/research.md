### Projects 

- **Development of an adsorbent material to remove Fluoride from water** </br>
  Developed a novel chitosan-biochar composite adsorbent material to remove fluoride from groundwater. Besides, a comparative study was done with raw chitosan powder. Fluoride sorption equilibrium was reached after 1 hour with an excellent removal efficiency of 90% for modified adsorbent while raw powder only exhibited a removal efficiency of 16%.
